## Technology Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js

## Approach Taken:
I wanted to update my portfolio to be more readible, easier to use, and to render properly on mobile. I wanted to have a more dynamic home page, and showcase my projects in a better way. This is the second version of my portfolio, and will be continually updated in the future. 


## Future Optimizations:
* Light/dark mode button in the top right
* Add different colors/option to change colors of homepage
* More information on projects and project images
* Better, more dynamic images for my project pages
